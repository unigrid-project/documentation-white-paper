This paper is © 2021 The Unigrid Foundation. However, this paper can
be freely shared and distributed and published without prior consent from
The Unigrid Foundation, as long as this license is included.

This paper is a continuous draft and should not be taken as an absolute
description of the future state and implementation of the network. Rather,
this paper will evolve together with the evolution of the network and the
protocol.

To preserve the historical work of the foundation, all public versions and
the release history of this paper and it’s specifications will be published
on the website of The Unigrid Foundation (https://www.unigrid.org).

Intermediate development releases should be called ‘draft versions‘. When
The Unigrid Foundation makes a formal and public release implementing the
functionality as described in this paper, the paper should, together with that
release of the network, be labelled as a ‘final version‘.

The algorithms and descriptions covered herein may not be used to implement a
separate implementation, network or product outside the oversight of
The Unigrid Foundation.

If any solution, product or network uses the algorithms or descriptions as
described in this paper, in their own implementations, without the explicit
permission of The Unigrid Foundation, the foundation has the right to seek
compensation. As supported by the statutes of The Unigrid Foundation, the
foundation does this to protect the integrity and stability of the Unigrid
network, limiting network fragmentation and promoting the growth of an
anonymous decentralized, global Internet that anyone can use and join.

In no event will The Unigrid Foundation be liable for any damages, including
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out
of the use, distribution or publication of this paper.
